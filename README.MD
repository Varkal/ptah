## Ptah ##

Ptah is a command line tool to detemplate project.

Tired to recreate the same files all the time ? Write your boilerplate once in a Ptah blueprint ans it will handle it for you the next time

*Work in progress*

**TODO**
* Provide an example blueprint
* Documentation on how to write blueprints
* Add tests
* Add commands to synchronize library_folder with a distant one. (Central server ? Git repository ? Anything else ?)
